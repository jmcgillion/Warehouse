Alyssa noticed that this will fail if you call this with an input of 0 or a negative number and asked Alan to change the loop. How can you change the loop construct (instead of using begin/end/until) to make this work? Note that we're not looking to find the factors for 0 or negative numbers, but we just want to handle it gracefully instead of raising an exception or going into an infinite loop.

Bonus 1

What is the purpose of the number % dividend == 0 ?

Bonus 2

What is the purpose of the second-to-last line in the method (the divisors before the method's end)?
